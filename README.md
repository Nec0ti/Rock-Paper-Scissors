# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Introduction

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in JavaScript using Math.random().

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Player selects either rock, paper, or scissors.
3. The winner of the round is determined based on the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors rules:
   - Rock crushes scissors.
   - Scissors cuts paper.
   - Paper covers rock.
4. The winner of each round is displayed, and the overall winner is determined after a set number of rounds.

## Implementation Details

- The game uses the `Math.random()` function to randomly generate the choices for both players.
- The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, and the HTML file (`index.html`) handles the user interface.
- The `rps.js` file contains the main game logic.
- The styles are defined in the `rps.css` file.
